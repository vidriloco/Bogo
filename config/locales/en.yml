        title: "Why should DF implement Transit Oriented Development (TOD)?"
        core: "Transit Oriented Development (TOD) reduces the need to travel long distances and provides an opportunity for densification, so that a travel can make by walking, cycling or using public transit. "
        intro: "This strategy can be implemented in Mexico City and its metropolitan area, thanks to the existence of a good network of 547 km of public transit, comprising Metro, Metrobus, Electric Transport Service (trolleybus), a commuter train - and Mexibus (in the State of Mexico). ITDP has made this data visualization that allows exploring the existing public transit networks, plus the new BRT lines proposed by ITDP and its relation to the demographic, housing and economic variables, in order to identify opportunities for Transit Oriented Development in the city."

        title: "The TOD at detail"
        intro: "In Mexico City, within 800 meters around 1004 public transit stations, there are many opportunities, for example: 163,355 vacant homes, which would cover 29% of the housing needs to 2020, are located. Opportunities that multiply with the implementation the proposed 29 lines of BRT <a href='http://mexico.itdp.org/wp-content/uploads/Resumen-Ejecutivo-ZMVMb.pdf' target='_blank'>proposed by ITDP</a>, in which surroundings are, located other 28,847 vacant homes, which would meet the housing needs of 34.7% of the population growth to 2020. Whit this could prevent urban sprawl of the city and thus, driving their actual development toward sustainability."
