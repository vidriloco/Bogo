        title: "Why should DF implement Transit Oriented Development (TOD)?"
        core: "Transit Oriented Development (TOD) reduces the need to travel long distances and provides an opportunity for densification, so that a journey can be made by walking, cycling or using public transit. "
        intro: "This <a href='http://mexico.itdp.org/documentos/hacia-una-estrategia-de-desarrollo-orientado-al-transporte-para-el-distrito-federal/'>TOD strategy can be implemented in Mexico City</a> and its metropolitan area, thanks to the existence of a good network of 537 km of public transit, comprising Metro, Metrobus, Electric Transport Service (trolleybus), a commuter train - and Mexibus (in the State of Mexico). ITDP has made this data visualization that allows exploring the existing public transit networks, plus the new BRT lines proposed by ITDP and its relation to the demographic, housing and economic variables, in order to identify opportunities for Transit Oriented Development in the city."

        intro: "ITDP has developed a proposal for how it should be a TOD strategy for the Federal District, in a working document (<a href='http://mexico.itdp.org/documentos/hacia-una-estrategia-de-desarrollo-orientado-al-transporte-para-el-distrito-federal/'>downloadable here</a>). This shows that there are many opportunities to promote the TOD, which could the urban sprawl of the city and drive its development towards sustainability."
